# FitApp - UX/UI Case Study & Prototype

**Authors:** Mintesnot Yimer, Pamit Duggal, Moeez Ahmed  
**Context:** M2 MIAGE - Innovative Information Systems (Université Toulouse 1 Capitole)  
**Tools:** Balsamiq, Paper Prototyping, SUS Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
FitApp is a user-centered mobile application designed for amateur triathletes balancing training with demanding work/family schedules. 
* [cite_start]**Problem:** Existing apps (Strava, Garmin) lack features for planning around family constraints or managing injury risks for casual users[cite: 827, 834].
* **Solution:** An adaptive training planner with "Safety-First" logic and family-aware scheduling.
* [cite_start]**Result:** The final prototype achieved a **System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 76.25** ("Good" to "Excellent") during user testing[cite: 823, 1142].

## 2. Design Process
We followed a 4-step iterative design process:

### Step 1: User Research & Persona
[cite_start]We designed for **"Paul"**, a busy father recovering from a leg injury[cite: 821].
* **Core Needs:** Time management (family/work), Injury prevention, Flexibility.
* [cite_start]**Key Innovation:** Unlike competitors, FitApp integrates "free time slots" from a user's calendar to suggest realistic workouts[cite: 981, 1037].

### Step 2: Prototyping (Low to Mid-Fidelity)
* [cite_start]**Paper Prototypes:** Rapidly sketched 8 core screens to test navigation flows[cite: 896].
* [cite_start]**Balsamiq Wireframes:** Created 10 interactive screens to simulate user journeys, focusing on layout and flow over visual polish[cite: 964].

### Step 3: Usability Testing & Evaluation
We conducted rigorous testing using three methods:
1.  [cite_start]**Task-Centered Walkthrough:** Verified specific scenarios like "Rescheduling a run due to a sick child"[cite: 1076].
2.  [cite_start]**Heuristic Evaluation:** Identify violations of Nielsen’s usability heuristics (e.g., adding "Toast" confirmations to improve *Visibility of System Status*)[cite: 1167].
3.  [cite_start]**SUS Testing:** Achieved a mean score of **76.25/100**[cite: 1392].

### Step 4: Iteration & Redesign
Based on testing data, we improved the prototype:
* [cite_start]**Training Load:** Redesigned specific warnings (e.g., "Load High - Rest Tomorrow") to be more actionable for injury prevention.
* [cite_start]**Feedback Loops:** Added "Toast" notifications to confirm schedule changes[cite: 1360].
* [cite_start]**Clarity:** Added icons to the "Change Today" options to reduce cognitive load[cite: 1259].

## 3. Key Views
*(Insert your screenshots here)*
* **Home Dashboard:** Quick overview of daily tasks.
* **Training Load:** Visualizing impact to prevent injury.
* **Adaptive Scheduling:** "Change Today" flow for unexpected life events.
