# FitApp - UX/UI Wireframe Prototype

## Project Overview
**FitApp** is a mobile application concept designed to help athletes manage training loads while recovering from injuries. The design focuses on **user safety**, **simplicity**, and **adaptability**.

* **Tool Used:** Balsamiq
* **Focus:** UX Principles, User Flow, Interaction Design
* **Target User:** "Paul," an athlete recovering from a leg injury who has a busy schedule.

## Key Features & Design Decisions

### 1. Safety-First Interaction
I designed a "Safety-first trigger" on the daily workout screen. If the user feels tired, they can tap "I feel tired - change plan" to immediately see safer alternatives (Skip, Shorter Session, Different Sport).

### 2. Cognitive Load Management
The "Home Dashboard" is designed to be scannable in seconds. It provides an immediate overview of today's workout and quick shortcuts to "Training Load" and "Progress" without cluttering the interface.

### 3. Logic & Feedback Loops
The prototype includes logic for confirmation states (Toast messages) to assure the user that their schedule has been successfully updated after a modification.
